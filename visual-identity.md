## Scala Center Visual Identity Guidelines

### Logo

There are two acceptable versions of the Scala Center logo.
The first one consists of:

* the "swirl" graphic
* the Scala Center name

The second one includes the above and also contains:

* the mission statement: "For open source. For education."

It is possible to use different combinations of the default color palette, depending on the use case and on background.

### Default color palette

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Hex</th><th>RGB</th><th>CMYK</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><th>Orange</th><td>#f1592a</td><td>241, 89, 42</td><td>0, 63, 100, 5</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Petrol</th><td>#002b36</td><td>0, 43, 54</td><td>100, 20, 0, 79</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Logo versions

We recommend to use one of the two following versions as the first choice on a clear background (white, light grey, etc.).

#### Alternative

On dark backgrounds, use the orange swirl and white text:

<img style="background-color: darkgrey" src="/resources/img/scala-center-logo.png">

<img style="background-color: darkgrey" src="/resources/img/scala-center-main-logo.png">

On colored backgrounds, you may use the white swirl and white text:

<img style="background-color: brown" src="/resources/img/scala-center-logo-white.png">

<img style="background-color: brown" src="/resources/img/scala-center-main-logo-white.png">

### Swirl only

The swirl only, without the text, should only be used in its colored version:
