## Scala 2 report

This was presented by Seth.

Scala Newsletter is out today, and covers both Scala 3 and Scala 2.
Let us know what you think, as this will be the template for future
issues, which will be published quarterly.

Since the last meeting, we published a blog post about our Scala 2
maintenance plans.  2.Note that 2.12 is now under minimal maintenance.

Scala 2.13.15 and 2.13.16 came out since the last meeting.  Changes
were modest and focused on compatibility, on supporting Scala 3
migration, and on improvements to warnings and linting.  There have
been no 2.13.16 regression reports, so if anyone was holding back on
upgrading, I'd say go ahead.

As usual, we've opened threads on the Contributors forum for
discussing plans for the next releases:

* 2.13.17: https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scala-2-13-17-release-planning/6994
* 2.12.21: https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scala-2-12-21-release-planning/6753

We plan for
[SIP-51](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/drop-stdlib-forwards-bin-compat.html)
(resuming making additions to the standard library) to be a theme
for 2.13.17.

Chris asked: if the primary motivation for maintaining 2.12 is sbt 1,
does that mean that when sbt 2 comes out, 2.12 be EOLed?  Seth
responded: perhaps eventually, but not right away. We are assuming a
longer timeframe since sbt 1 will remain in wide use for some time yet
to come, even once sbt 2 is available.

## Elections

For chairperson, Chris Kipp put his name forward to continue as chair
and was elected unanimously. (Chairs are not expected to serve for
longer than one year, but a willing chair is also welcome to serve for
longer.)

Also re-elected without any other nominations being made were Martin
Odersky (technical advisor) and Seth Tisue (secretary).

## Community report

This section was led by Eugene and Zainab.

## Conclusion

The next meeting will be held online, probably in late April or early
May. If possible, the fall meeting will be held in-person at EPFL.
